# Special Interest Groups

To get involved with any SIG, go directly to the MCC section of the Intersect discord, where each SIG has its own discord channel.

### Nexus Interest Group&#x20;

Nexus aims to enable non-technical and time-limited Cardano community members to contribute meaningfully. It organizes contributions through roles and activities without financial compensation, instead offering recognition. This initiative hopes to transform spectators into contributors, reducing treasury expenses, and strengthening community engagement. Website:[ www.cardanonexus.org](http://www.cardanonexus.org).

### Accounting Interest Group&#x20;

Intersect Groups struggle with financial management, leading to inefficiencies and risks. The proposed Accounting Service Group (ASG) will provide financial training, support, and compliance, and act as a liaison with the Budget Committee. This will improve financial reporting, budgeting, and resource allocation, strengthening the organization's financial foundation and reputation.

### Decentralized Trust and Identity SIG&#x20;

The Trust & Identity SIG aims to connect Cardano community members and organizations around SSI, Identity, and Trust solutions. It promotes networking, highlights active contributors, and fosters community engagement. The group plans to create a directory, facilitate synergies, and host regular meetings with guest speakers to share insights and opportunities.
