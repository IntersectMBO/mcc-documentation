### MCC Meetings

Committee Meetings - The MCC currently meets weekly on a Tuesday, the time varies as we rotate this to ensure we can have regular inputs from the committee and community members around the world.  The meeting notes will be published under the "Committee Meeting Notes" section of this space. &#x20;

Office Hours - The MCC are also exploring holding "Office Hour" Sessions so the community can come and learn more about the committee, discuss ideas, ask questions and provide feedback.  We hope to have these up and running by the end of May 24.
