# About Membership and Community Committee (MCC)

## What is the Membership and Community Committee?

The Membership and Community Committee (MCC) fosters a thriving Cardano community by understanding the interests of Intersect members and stakeholders, and advising Intersect staff on how to work with them in areas such as membership sales and account management, community support, tooling grants, education, and engaging events.

## Why is this committee important?

It devises strategies to engage community members, promote collaboration, and encourage meaningful contributions. By organizing events, forums, and online platforms, the committee creates spaces for interaction and knowledge-sharing among community participants.

## Which topics does this committee cover?

The MCC oversees membership within Intersect and, by doing so, ensures that each member has access to benefits and opportunities for fuller participation in Cardanoâ€™s growth and development.&#x20;

### MCC Meetings

The MCC currently meets weekly on a Tuesday, the time varies as we rotate this to ensure we can have regular inputs from the committee and community members around the world.  The meeting notes will be published under the "Committee Meeting Notes" section of this space. &#x20;

The committee is, as of June '24, looking into ways to extend its service of Intersect's members and stakeholders through more outreach and communication.
