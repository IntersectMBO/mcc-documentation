# About the Membership and Community Committee (MCC)

## What is the Membership and Community Committee?

The Membership and Community Committee (MCC)'s north star is enhancing Intersect's value to its members as Cardano's members-based organization.

This involves...

1. socializing and overseeing the Community Grants and Outreach and Education buckets of the Cardano annual budget
2. acting as a hub of knowledge the Cardano ecosystem to foster connection and decision making
3. advising Intersect staff in areas such as membership sales and account management, community support, grants, education, and events

## Why is this committee important?

The MCC aims to ensure that institutions, groups, and individuals involved in governance or building on Cardano have an fair and accurate map of ecosystem resources and opportunities.

The committee ensures that the budget earmarked for the ecosystem outside of core R\&D are allocated, managed, and overseen in a way that serves Cardano's interests.

The committee also aims to provide Intersect members with a framework for community engagement, collaboration, and meaningful contributions within Intersect and in the Cardano ecosystem.&#x20;

## Which topics does this committee cover?

Intersect - The MCC oversees membership within Intersect and, by doing so, ensures that each member has access to benefits and opportunities for fuller participation in Cardanoâ€™s growth and development.&#x20;

Ecosystem - The MCC provides a format for the ecosystem to self-organize through special interest groups and it oversees the allocation of Cardano's ecosystem-focused budget to proven and promising suppliers alike. The committee provides the ecosystem both a vehicle to self-organize and the stimulus for new innovation and growth.

### MCC Meetings

The MCC currently meets weekly on a Tuesday, the time varies as we rotate this to ensure we can have regular inputs from the committee and community members around the world.  The meeting notes will be published under the "Committee Meeting Notes" section of this space. &#x20;

The committee is, as of June '24, looking into ways to extend its service of Intersect's members and stakeholders through more outreach and communication.
