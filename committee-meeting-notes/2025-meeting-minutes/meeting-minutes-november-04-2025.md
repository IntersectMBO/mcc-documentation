| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Meeting Schedule Check              | Discussion about the date of the previous meeting (28th) and setting the current meeting date.                                                                                                                               | Confusion around the meeting date/calendar entry. Darlington will add the current meeting to the calendar.                                                                                                          |
| Round of Check-ins                  | Darlington started a round of check-ins while waiting for others. Laurentine, Boaz, Ha, Ael, Maureen, Sanjaya, and Fanny checked in, sharing their current status and meeting expectations.                                  | Ael is traveling and has a cold (5:00 a.m. his time). Ha is hoping for next steps on NCC. Fanny is feeling better.                                                                                                  |
| Tentative Agenda Review             | Darlington reviewed the proposed agenda: working group check-in, ClickUp usage, roles/responsibilities (leftover), 2026 budget for NCC, and community support conversation.                                                  | Abby noted the overlap between community support and community hubs. Darlington will check Discord for details on the community support item.                                                                       |
| ISC Call Follow-up                  | Darlington asked if anyone attended the Monday ISC call and if there were any actions for the committees.                                                                                                                    | Terence joined and clarified the ISC call timing. Item moved to AOB (but time ran out).                                                                                                                             |
| Members Benefits Update             | Matthew reported no progress, feeling lost on who has the authority to move things forward. He requested an Intersect staff co-owner for guidance.                                                                           | Abby noted he previously filled out the ownership section in Matthew’s document. Matthew suggested ClickUp might be the best medium for task assignment.                                                            |
| Next Steps for Member Benefits      | Discussion on the next actionable steps for the member benefits proposals.                                                                                                                                                   | Darlington suggested creating ClickUp tasks for the items (potentially bundled) and moving into a proposal drafting phase, noting some items (like office hours) may not need big approval.                         |
| Community Hubs Letter to Board      | Sanjaya drafted a request letter to the board for reserve funds to support existing hubs and sought feedback/approval from the MCC.                                                                                          | Nick offered to propose the letter as an agenda item for the November Intersect board meeting and represent it.                                                                                                     |
| Hubs Working Group Structure        | Sanjaya proposed a temporary, focused working group comprising MCC members, Intersect staff, and current hub managers to structure the Catalyst/2026 budget proposals before opening it to the wider community.              | Discussion on transparency and appearance of exclusion. Matthew suggested the letter come solely from the MCC. Proposal for a closed working group was approved by majority vote.                                   |
| Hubs Language Barriers              | Laurentine emphasized the critical need to address language barriers (e.g., French-speaking communities) in hub planning, citing previous community efforts.                                                                 | The need for regional/language-specific hubs was recognized as vital for community building. Laurentine and Boaz encouraged to be part of the working group.                                                        |
| Project Management (ClickUp)        | Darlington asked about committee members writing tasks in ClickUp. Matthew confirmed he hadn't. Marine and Darlington discussed the need for using ClickUp effectively.                                                      | Marine requested a system for tracking deliverables, owners, and deadlines (KPIs, communication tasks, document reviews). Darlington, Marine, and Abby will have a separate call to clean up ClickUp and add tasks. |
| ClickUp Login Status                | A quick check to ensure all members have logged into and can access ClickUp.                                                                                                                                                 | All members confirmed they have logged in successfully.                                                                                                                                                             |
| Roles and Responsibilities Document | Discussion on the MCC roles and responsibilities document shared by Marine. Abby suggested a shorter, one-pager summary due to the document's length.                                                                        | Action Item: Create a one-pager summary with key expectations (e.g., 48-hour review target) to accompany the detailed document.                                                                                     |
| Incentives and Accountability       | Matthew raised concerns about enforcement and suggested a public record of contributions to track good standing, linking it to future voting decisions. Marine agreed, suggesting public "shaming" for lack of contribution. | Discussion on accountability. Compensation (500 ADA) is tied to a public monthly contribution report.                                                                                                               |
| Async Work and Review Period        | Marine stressed the importance of reviewing shared documents before the meeting to save time, noting the repeated failure to do so has slowed the committee.                                                                 | The committee is struggling with async work. Next call to focus on gamification and 2026 budget.                                                                                                                    |
