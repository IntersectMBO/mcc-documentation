| DREP-Led Budget Sessions                      | Darlington Wleh attended budget sessions where DREPs primarily drove the agenda. MCC topics did not come up unless DREPs had specific questions. Lots of questions were asked about MCC line items. The items discussed were ranked by positive sentiment and engagement on "go to schools" (likely refers to GovToolâ€™s sentiment analysis).                             | <p><br></p>                                                                                                                         |
| Voting Period Extension                       | Voting for proposals is being extended.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | <p><br></p>                                                                                                                         |
| Lack of Quorum and Open Agenda                | There was no quorum for the current meeting, and the agenda was kept open and short.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | <p><br></p>                                                                                                                         |
| Intersect Budget Timeline                     | Pedro Lucas raised concern about the lack of Intersect representation at reconciliation workshops, where questions about the Intersect budget timeline arose. He felt a unified Intersect voice was missing.                                                                                                                                                             | <p><br></p>                                                                                                                         |
| Community Hubs Initiative                     | Pedro Lucas, a potential applicant for an online community hub, sought to understand the MCC's perspective on the initiative's progress. He expressed skepticism about reported achievements outside of Europe, specifically asking for "receipts" or evidence of impact.                                                                                                | Pedro Lucas to continue reaching out to communities and event organizers to join the online hub space.                              |
| Online Hub Space                              | Pedro Lucas is spearheading an initiative to create an online space for grassroots communities and small projects to network. He will host an open call within 24 hours.                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Pedro Lucas to drop personal link (pedallucas.net) and Twitter thread for the open call.                                            |
| MCC Community Hubs Expansion Proposal         | The MCC Community Hubs Expansion proposal is currently ranked around seventh, making it likely to pass.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | <p><br></p>                                                                                                                         |
| Transparency and Reporting for Community Hubs | Pedro Lucas advocated for transparency and realistic, evidence-based public reports from community hubs, questioning the current summary reports and calling for a "clean slate" for re-granting titles. Sheldon Hunt provided historical context, explaining that early on, documentation was not made public due to setup issues at Intersect and a lack of resources. | <p><br></p>                                                                                                                         |
| Sri Lankan Community Hub Activities           | Sanjaya Wanigasekera reported on the Sri Lankan hub's activities, including monthly town halls, meetup events, and educational workshops for university students, along with budget proposal review events.                                                                                                                                                              | Sanjaya Wanigasekera to share information on Sri Lankan hub's activities and reporting with Pedro Lucas.                            |
| Public Availability of Hub Reports            | Pedro Lucas inquired if hub reports are made public and where they can be found. Sanjaya Wanigasekera confirmed weekly/monthly reporting to Hannah and Nick but was unsure about public access. Sheldon Hunt agreed that more publicly available documentation is needed and suggested a "reset" after the current election.                                             | Darlington Wleh to ask Nick and Hannah to share current reporting documents with the working group, even if not publicly published. |
| Future Hub Selection Criteria and KPIs        | The selection criteria for future hubs has been postponed to allow for broader community input, especially from interested parties and those who have run workshops. Efforts are underway to define KPIs and distribution strategies for future hubs.                                                                                                                    | Community Hubs Working Group to continue discussions on selection criteria and KPIs for future hubs.                                |
| Meeting Adjournment                           | Due to the budget being posted and moved to a new tool, the previously scheduled budget meeting for next week is cancelled. The regular meeting will resume in two weeks.                                                                                                                                                                                                | Darlington Wleh to update the meeting schedule to reflect the cancellation of next week's budget meeting.                           |
