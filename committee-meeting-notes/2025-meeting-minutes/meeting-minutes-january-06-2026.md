| Topic                         | Discussion                                                                                                                                                                                       | Notes                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| In-Person Events Proposal     | Olivier proposed organizing local, in-person community meetings and workshops (50–100 people) to drive Cardano ecosystem contributions.                                                          | Decision: Move Olivier’s proposal to the Participation Backlog for future scoping.                                  |
| Guest Introduction            | Meek, a developer from Nairobi, Kenya, introduced himself. He is participating in the DevEx working group and joined out of curiosity.                                                           | Maureen welcomed the Kenyan community representative to the call.                                                   |
| 2026 Hubs Strategy            | Maureen noted that the 2026 budget process begins soon. She highlighted the need to reactivate Hubs with better transparency and a proper accountability framework to regain community interest. | Goal: Get Hubs included in the official 2026 Intersect budget.                                                      |
| Hubs Working Group Alignment  | Maureen suggested leveraging work done by previous groups rather than reinventing the wheel. Fanny and Akil were noted as participants in prior efforts.                                         | Action: Fanny to contact the previous Hubs lead on Discord to invite them to the next meeting.                      |
| Miro to ClickUp Migration     | Wilco clarified that all tasks and assignees from the Miro board have been successfully moved to ClickUp. Abhik requested a progress report on these tasks.                                      | Miro is now secondary; ClickUp is the primary tracking tool.                                                        |
| Open Office Hours (X Spaces)  | Sanjaya confirmed that weekly MCC Office Hours will start next Monday on X. The sessions allow community members to raise concerns to be addressed in Tuesday's committee meetings.              | Action: Sanjaya and Abhik to coordinate the schedule. Members are encouraged to retweet the link for amplification. |
| Midnight & Outreach Update    | Chaya reported engaging with other ecosystems (like XRP and Midnight). At least one person from the XRP community has officially joined Intersect through these efforts.                         | Chaya shared a social media calendar workflow with Maureen and Abhik.                                               |
| Dev Report Integration        | Abhik is working with the Head of Comms (Tim) to include MCC X Spaces and updates in the weekly Intersect Dev Report for higher visibility.                                                      | Action: Abhik to finalize this integration for the next report.                                                     |
| Operational Scope & Approvals | Maureen advised workstream leads to focus on tasks that the MCC can execute independently to avoid the "months-long" delay of board approvals.                                                   | Policy: Refine backlog to prioritize immediate, autonomous actions.                                                 |
| Member Time Commitments       | Maureen reminded elected members of their 20-hour-per-month commitment to Intersect work. She emphasized that work must happen between meetings, not just during them.                           | Requirement: Increase async work and updates in the MCC Discord channel.                                            |
