* **Cataloging and Promoting Committee Office Hours:** Working with committees to publicize existing or new office hours to the membership.
* **Webinars/Workshops (Member Hosted Mini Sessions):** Developing a model for members to host mini-sessions, ranging from educational talks to demonstrations, to foster deeper connections and knowledge sharing.
* **Enterprise Sign-up Package Enhancements:** Incorporating high-value benefits for enterprise members, such as Securing Event Speaking Slots and providing Discounts on activities like the Cardano Summit.
* **Working Group Formation:** The committee agreed to define the work and stand up a working group to own the implementation and execution plan for the selected membership benefit initiatives, ensuring continuity across MCC member elections.
* **Next Meeting Schedule:** A decision was made to meet weekly for the immediate future.

Actions

* **Community Hub Outreach:** Darlington (or the Intersect team) will send an email to try and track down the Community Hub leads.
* **Draft Execution Plans:** Darlington, Matthew, and Sanjaya will draft a detailed execution plan/project plan for the three selected benefit initiatives (Office Hours, Webinars/Workshops, Enterprise Package). This will be reviewed next week.
* **Define Working Group:** Darlington, Matthew, and Sanjaya will define the scope and remit for the new working group responsible for implementing the membership benefit initiatives.
* **Draft Election Comms:** Darlington will draft communications (e.g., social media posts) for the upcoming elections, including instructions, timelines, contact info, and quotes/sound bites ("reflections") from current members.
* **Review Onboarding Doc:** Terence called for volunteers to review the MCC onboarding document to prepare for new members joining in November.
* **Update Benefit Document:** Laurentine will add specific details (e.g., list of potential discounts) to the shared membership benefit document.
* **Investigate Social Media Updates:** Darlington/Terence will look into posting smaller, more frequent updates on the MCC X (social media) page.

| Board Election Results                | Sanjaya mentioned checking the board election results.                                                                                                                                                                                                               | No further details on results.                                                                                                                                                             |
| Agenda Items Review                   | Darlington reviewed the agenda: finalize the membership benefit document, committee elections, and language support. He decided to postpone the Community Hubs discussion.                                                                                           | Darlington confirmed the ClickUp link access for committee members and shared his screen.                                                                                                  |
| Community Hubs Discussion             | The discussion was postponed as the leads were "hard to pin down." Darlington suggested an email to the Intersect team to follow up.                                                                                                                                 | Decision was made to move forward with the discussion next week regardless of showing.                                                                                                     |
| Next Meeting Date                     | Terence asked about the next meeting date. Darlington proposed meeting next Tuesday.                                                                                                                                                                                 | Terence agreed to set up the call for next Tuesday.                                                                                                                                        |
| Membership Benefit Document           | The group aimed to finalize the document, including a new suggestion from the Intersect team, and select 2-4 items for immediate implementation (October/November).                                                                                                  | Lorenzo was asked to provide context on the document and the new suggestion.                                                                                                               |
| Action Plan on Benefits               | The goal was to select 3-4 high-impact benefits to focus on implementing.                                                                                                                                                                                            | Matthew suggested discussing the "low-hanging fruit" options from the document.                                                                                                            |
| Proposed Benefits for Action (1 of 3) | Matthew proposed Committee Office Hours across various committees, not just the MCC, to be promoted to members so they know they can come and talk to committee representatives.                                                                                     | Darlington liked the idea, noting that benefits often aren't used because people forget.                                                                                                   |
| Proposed Benefits for Action (2 of 3) | Gintama suggested a Giveaway/Upgrade from Associate to Individual Membership for showing up/participation, noting it might not cost anything, as it's an internal upgrade.                                                                                           | Fanny proposed a Working Group to "chase down some of these things and make sure they happen."                                                                                             |
| Proposed Benefits for Action (3 of 3) | Maureen suggested Securing Speaking Slots for enterprises at major Cardano events, calling it an "actual value that people can pay $1,000" for. She also proposed promoting enterprise members in newsletters and on social media (e.g., "today is lighter nation"). | Sanjaya suggested a Summarized Version of Newsletters in Specific Languages (e.g., Sri Lankan translations), which he offered to help with.                                                |
| Decision on Top 3 Benefits            | The committee needed to narrow the list down to three initiatives to focus on for the next two months.                                                                                                                                                               | The top 3 items selected were: Cataloging and Promoting Office Hours, Webinars/Workshops (Member Hosted Mini Sessions), and the Enterprise Sign-up Package/Event Speaking Slots/Discounts. |
| Forming a Working Group               | A working group was discussed to define the work and execution plan for the selected benefits. Gintama supported a working group to ensure continuity across new member elections.                                                                                   | Volunteers to define the work: Matthew and Sanjaya volunteered. Maureen offered to join after a busy upcoming week.                                                                        |
| Committee Elections Comms             | Discussions focused on communications for the elections opening tomorrow (October 1st).                                                                                                                                                                              | Suggestions included: publishing instructions, timeline, contact info, acknowledging accessibility concerns, and including "reflections" (quotes/sound bites) from current members.        |
| Future Meeting Schedule               | Darlington proposed meeting again next Tuesday due to the volume of work and need for decisions, with the goal of having a draft proposal for the selected benefits ready.                                                                                           | Terence confirmed he would schedule the meeting. Community Hub leads will be invited to the next call.                                                                                     |
